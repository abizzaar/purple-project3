# Pollen

*Ever wonder what other people are thinking?*

Pollen is a place where people share their voices and opinions with polls. Collecting valuable datasets on human preferences, this app has the power to train machine learning models, better inform about society, and predict trends in human behavior.

Create a poll and gather opinions! <br />

Ask questions like:

```
"Who does everyone think will win the national election?"
"What's your favorite makeup brand for mascara?"
"Vim or Emacs?"
```

Options include publishing a poll, responding to a poll, viewing poll statistics, categorizing a poll by topic, searching polls by topic categories, and more.

**See the impact in the numbers!**

To run the app, navigate to your terminal and type: 
```
$ cd purple-project3/
$ yarn
$ expo start

```
